            <p className="my-4">"I recently got my hands on Flowbite Pro, and holy crap, I'm speechless with how easy this was to integrate within my application. Most templates are a pain, code is scattered, and near impossible to theme."</p>
            <p className="my-4">"Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customize it and integrate within a Laravel + Vue application."</p>
            <p className="my-4">"If you care for your time, I hands down would go with this."</p>

From the most used UI components like forms and navigation bars to the whole app screens designed both for desktop and mobile, this UI kit provides a solid foundation for any project."</p>
            <p className="my-4">"Designing with Figma components that can be easily translated to the utility classes of Tailwind CSS is a huge timesaver!"</p>
